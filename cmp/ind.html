            Premier League champions City's next assignment is at Rodney Parade, where they will do battle with Flynn's Newport team for a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals.
            Flynn and Arteta got to know each other when they studied together for a Pro Licence - the highest coaching qualification in football - under the guidance of the Football Association of Wales (FAW) at Dragon Park in Newport.
            Also on their course were a range of footballing figures, from former Arsenal stars Henry and Ljungberg to Liverpool assistant coach Pep Lijnders and Welsh Premier managers like Andy Morrison of Connah's Quay Nomads and Bala Town's Colin Caton.</p>
